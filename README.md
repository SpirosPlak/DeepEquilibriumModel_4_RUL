# A Deep Equilibrium Model for Remaining Useful Life of Aircraft Engines

This repository contains the code implementation for the scientific study titled:  
**"A Deep Equilibrium Model for Remaining Useful Life of Aircraft Engines."**

The work presents a novel approach leveraging **Deep Equilibrium Models (DEMs)** for the prediction of **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** in aircraft engines. It combines fixed-point modeling with Bayesian calibration to handle uncertainty in degradation forecasting.

## ðŸ§  Overview

- **Deep Equilibrium Models (DEMs)**: A class of implicit-depth models where the output is a fixed point of a learned dynamical system.
- **Bayesian Inference**: Used for uncertainty quantification in RUL prediction.
- **Dataset**: NASAâ€™s C-MAPSS dataset for turbofan engine degradation simulation.

Estimating Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is crucial in modern Prognostic and
Health Management (PHM) systems providing valuable information for planning the
maintenance strategy of critical components in complex systems such as aircraft engines.
Deep Learning (DL) models have shown great performance in the accurate prediction
of RUL, building hierarchical representations by the stacking of multiple explicit neural
layers. In the current research paper, we follow a different approach presenting a Deep
Equilibrium Model (DEM) that effectively captures the spatial and temporal information
of the sequential sensor. The DEM, which incorporates convolutional layers and a novel
dual-input interconnection mechanism to capture sensor information effectively, estimates
the degradation representation implicitly as the equilibrium solution of an equation, rather
than explicitly computing it through multiple layer passes. The convergence representation
of the DEM is estimated by a fixed-point equation solver while the computation of the
gradients in the backward pass is made using the Implicit Function Theorem (IFT). The
Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) technique under calibration is the final key component of
the framework that enhances regularization and performance providing a confidence
interval for each prediction, contributing to a more robust and reliable outcome. Simulation
experiments on the widely used NASA Turbofan Jet Engine Data Set show consistent
improvements, with the proposed framework offering a competitive alternative for RUL
prediction under diverse conditions.
